# Arrow Type Character Sets

A place to store & share useful starter character sets for type design in RoboFont.

## How to use

In RoboFont, there is a Preferences panel for [defining character sets](https://robofont.com/documentation/how-tos/defining-character-sets/). You can copy-paste a character set like `ATC-en-sp-fr-pt-de.txt` into that.

These character set lists use names that RoboFont will automatically give Unicode values for, when added to a font.

Also notable: the RoboFont extension [GlyphBrowser](https://github.com/LettError/glyphBrowser) makes it easy to add more glyphs to a font, with unicode values, on an ad hoc basis.

## Files included

- `ASCII.txt` – A basic ASCII character set, e.g. for sketching new fonts
- `ATC-en-sp-fr-pt-de.txt` – A basic character set for English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German, based on information from [Alphabet Type Charset Builder](https://www.alphabet-type.com/tools/charset-builder/). Also includes arrows (duh).

I’ll post more here soon / as I need them.
